I don’t know who reads these. I don’t even know if this goes anywhere. But if you have access, please tell me.

My brother, Daniel [redacted]. Last year he was “diagnosed,” and then New Life came with their offer. He never said yes, I don't think, but he disappeared a week later. Corp said he was “relocated for treatment.” We never saw a body. We never saw anything at all. Just a copy-paste condolence message.

If you know if he’s in there please just tell us so my family has closure.

I can’t keep screaming into the void any longer.
