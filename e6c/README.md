# East Sixth Collective (e6c)

This folder is a small standalone site for the East Sixth Collective.

- Title: East Sixth Collective
- Lead: Slug (Avery) — structure: collective / consensus
- Slogan: WE OWN THE NET. THEY ONLY LEASE IT.
- Method: deliberately analog / low-tech (dead drops, ham radio). Digital comms are considered compromised.

Files:

- `index.html` — site entry
- `style.css` — local styling
- `script.js` — lightweight glitch for the symbol

If you want this to be a fully separate site, serve the `e6c` directory as its own site root or map a hostname to it.
