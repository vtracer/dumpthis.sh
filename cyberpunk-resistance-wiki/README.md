# Cyberpunk Resistance Wiki

Welcome to the **Cyberpunk Resistance Wiki**! This project is a static website that serves as a comprehensive resource for information about the resistance movement in a cyberpunk universe. 

## Project Overview

The Cyberpunk Resistance Wiki aims to provide detailed articles, images, and resources related to the various factions, key figures, and events within the cyberpunk resistance. The design mimics the familiar layout of Wikipedia, making it easy for users to navigate and find information.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files and directories:

- **index.html**: The main page of the wiki, containing the structure and content.
- **css/styles.css**: The stylesheet that defines the visual appearance of the website, including colors for proper names, nouns, and places.
- **images/placeholder.svg**: A placeholder image representing the cyberpunk resistance theme.
- **js/main.js**: A JavaScript file for future interactivity and dynamic content.
- **.gitignore**: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by version control.
- **README.md**: This documentation file.

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
