**NOT LIVE UNTIL THE BOOK IS LIVE**

**What this is**  
A public dead drop for in-universe fragments tied to *Maroon*

**Rules**
- In-universe only. No real names, no doxxing. Real world public locations are fine.
- `/logs` ≤ 500 words. Longer pieces → `/stories`.
- Keep tone: cold corporate or bleak resistance. Style guide coming soon.
- One file per story fragment. Include a 1–2 sentence context note in your PR description.

**How**
1. Fork the repo.
2. Add your file under `/logs` or `/stories`.
3. Open a Pull Request with a short note.
4. I curate. Fork ≠ canon.
5. In canon == linked on site.
